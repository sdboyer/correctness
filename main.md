**Correctness**

Correct software does exactly what it's expected to - no more, no less.

**The Correctness _Problem_**

* This is not how we actually make software today, because actually achieving it is REALLY HARD
* Like actually maybe so hard that it's beyond reasonable human capabilities
* The challenge of correctness goes back to the early days of computing - the 50s and 60s
* Do we...even need it? Not only is it not how we make software, but it's not how we engineer literally anything else

(more bits here...?)

How do we *make* software?

_(this one we can kind of answer)_

Start by asking, "what **should** the software do?"
